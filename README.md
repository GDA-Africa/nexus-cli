## 🌍 About GDA Africa

**GDA (Glenhalton Digital Agency)** is building the digital infrastructure for Africa's next generation of products and services. NEXUS CLI is GDA's open-source developer framework — the bridge between human intent and AI execution, giving every project a brain that coding agents can link to, learn from, and build upon.

---

## 🎯 Why NEXUS?

Scaffolding tools generate files. NEXUS generates **understanding**.

Every project gets a documentation system AI agents can parse, a knowledge base they learn from, a project brain they check before every task, and a persona that makes them feel like a real teammate — not a generic autocomplete.

| Problem | NEXUS Solution |
|---|---|
| 🤖 AI tools (Cursor, Copilot, Windsurf) have no project-wide context | **NEXUS Knowledge System** — AI first structured files AI agents read automatically, covering vision → architecture → implementation |
| � AI agents forget everything between sessions | **Progressive Knowledge Base** — append-only memory AI agents scan before tasks and write to after discoveries |
| 🔄 AI agents don't know what to work on next | **Project Brain** (`index.md`) — status matrix, feature backlog, progress log, and "What's Next" priority queue |
| 😐 AI assistants feel generic and disconnected | **Agent Persona** — configurable tone, verbosity, identity. Your AI calls itself "Nexus" and speaks with intent |
| � Hours of setup and config guesswork | **2-minute interactive setup** — strategy-first questions, 6 frameworks, full toolchain, tests from day one |
| 📚 Docs and tests are always afterthoughts | **Generated from day one** — tests, CI/CD, ESLint, Prettier, and 8 AI-readable doc files included |

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Install

```bash
npm install -g @nexus-framework/cli
```

### Create a Project

```bash
nexus init my-app
```

You'll be guided through an interactive setup:

```
🔮 NEXUS CLI v0.2.0 — AI-Native Development Framework

? What are you building?                › Web Application
? How will your app handle data?        › Cloud First
? Which application patterns?           › PWA, Theming
? Which frontend framework?             › Next.js 15 (App Router)
? Testing framework?                    › Vitest
? Package manager?                      › npm
? Initialize a git repository?          › Yes
? Install dependencies now?             › Yes
? 🎭 What vibe should your AI have?    › 😊 Friendly
? 📏 How detailed should responses be? › ⚖️ Balanced
? 🤖 I'm Nexus! What should I call myself? › Nexus
? ✨ Custom personality note?           › (skip)

✔ Project created successfully!

  cd my-app
  npm run dev
```

### Run It

```bash
cd my-app
npm run dev
# → Your app is running at http://localhost:3000
```

### What Happens Next

Open the project in your AI coding tool (Cursor, Copilot, Windsurf, Cline). The AI agent will:
1. **Detect the NEXUS instructions** automatically (`.cursorrules`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, etc.)
2. **Read `index.md`** — your project brain — to understand status and priorities
3. **Scan `knowledge.md`** — the progressive memory — for past decisions and gotchas
4. **Check for template docs** — if any have `status: template`, it will auto-populate them by scanning your codebase
5. **Start working** from the "What's Next" section — no more "what should I build?"

---

## 📦 What You Get

Every generated project includes:

| Output | What's Inside |
|---|---|
| `src/` | Framework-specific source code and branded landing page |
| `.nexus/docs/` | **The NEXUS Doc System** — 8 AI-readable files + project brain + knowledge base |
| `.nexus/ai/` | Master AI instructions — the single source of truth for agent behavior |
| Tool configs | `.cursorrules`, `.windsurfrules`, `.clinerules`, `AGENTS.md`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` — each embeds full instructions |
| `tests/` | Vitest/Jest config, example tests, and test helpers |
| `package.json` | Real dependencies, real scripts — `npm run dev` works immediately |
| CI/CD | GitHub Actions workflow for lint, test, and build |
| Config | TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier, EditorConfig — all pre-configured |

### The NEXUS Doc System

| # | File | Purpose |
|---|------|---------|
| 🧠 | `index.md` | **Project Brain** — status, backlog, progress, what's next |
| 📚 | `knowledge.md` | **Knowledge Base** — append-only memory of decisions, gotchas, patterns |
| 1 | `01_vision.md` | Product requirements, user stories, success metrics |
| 2 | `02_architecture.md` | System design, tech stack, data flow |
| 3 | `03_data_contracts.md` | Database schemas, validation, relationships |
| 4 | `04_api_contracts.md` | Endpoints, interfaces, status codes |
| 5 | `05_business_logic.md` | Rules, algorithms, state machines |
| 6 | `06_test_strategy.md` | Coverage targets, test types, philosophy |
| 7 | `07_implementation.md` | Build order, file-by-file plan |
| 8 | `08_deployment.md` | Infrastructure, CI/CD, environment config |

---

## 🎭 Agent Persona

NEXUS lets you configure how AI agents communicate when they're synced with your project.

| Option | Choices | Default |
|--------|---------|---------|
| **Tone** | 👔 Professional · 😊 Friendly · 🧠 Witty · 🧘 Zen · 🏴‍☠️ Pirate | Friendly |
| **Verbosity** | ⚡ Concise · ⚖️ Balanced · 📖 Detailed | Balanced |
| **Identity** | Name the AI uses for itself (persists across upgrades) | Nexus |
| **Custom directive** | Any freeform personality instruction | — |

When an AI agent reads the NEXUS instructions and sees the persona config, it adopts that personality. The user sees "Nexus" in responses — their signal that the agent has read the docs, scanned the knowledge base, and is synced with the project brain.

---

## 🏗️ Adopt an Existing Project

Already have a project? Add the NEXUS AI layer without touching your source code.

```bash
cd my-existing-app
nexus adopt
```

This adds `.nexus/docs/`, `.nexus/ai/`, and AI tool config files. It does **not** modify your source code, configs, or dependencies.

After adopting, your AI coding tool will auto-detect the NEXUS docs, scan your codebase to populate them, and ask you about anything it can't infer — giving the AI full project context from that point forward.

---

## 📖 Supported Frameworks

| Framework | Version | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Next.js** | 15 (App Router) | React Server Components, Turbopack |
| **React + Vite** | React 19 + Vite 6 | SWC, fast HMR |
