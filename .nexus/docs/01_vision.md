# NEXUS CLI - Vision & Product Requirements

**Project:** NEXUS CLI (Free Tier)

**Target Release:** March 2025  
**Last Updated:** February 7, 2025  

---

## 🎯 Product Vision

NEXUS CLI is an intelligent project scaffolding tool that generates production-ready, AI-optimized project structures with complete documentation templates. It's the first development tool designed for the AI era—where documentation drives development and AI agents are first-class citizens in the development process.

### The Problem We're Solving

**For Solo Developers:**
- Starting a new project requires hours of setup and configuration decisions
- AI coding tools (Cursor, Copilot) struggle with project-wide context
- Every project structure is different, making consistency impossible
- Tests and documentation are afterthoughts

**For Development Teams:**
- Onboarding new developers takes weeks
- No standard for AI-readable project documentation
- Project structure varies by developer preference
- Knowledge silos when team members leave

**For the Ecosystem:**
- No established conventions for AI-native development
- Fragmented tooling and approaches
- Missing bridge between requirements and code generation

### The Solution

NEXUS CLI provides:
1. **Strategy-First Setup** - Ask about goals, not just tech choices
2. **Complete Project Scaffolding** - Production-ready structure, not hello world
3. **AI-Optimized Documentation** - Structured templates AI can parse and execute
4. **Smart Defaults** - Best practices baked in based on user choices
5. **Upgrade Path** - Free CLI → Pro AI features when ready

## 🎨 User Experience Principles

### 1. Progressive Disclosure
Don't overwhelm with all options upfront. Show what matters now, reveal more as needed.

### 2. Smart Defaults
Every question should have a sensible default. Users can just hit Enter if they want.

### 3. Educational
Every choice should teach something. Explain trade-offs, not just options.

### 4. Fast
Setup should take < 2 minutes. No unnecessary questions or steps.

### 5. Delightful
Use color, emojis (sparingly), progress indicators. Make it feel modern and polished.

### 6. Professional
Generated code should look like a senior developer wrote it, not a robot.

## 📝 Notes

**Design Philosophy:**
NEXUS CLI is a teaching tool disguised as a productivity tool. Every generated file should include helpful comments. Every choice should explain why. Users should finish setup smarter than when they started.

**Accessibility:**
CLI should work on Mac, Windows (WSL), Linux. Clear error messages. Graceful degradation if network issues.

**Future Vision:**
Free CLI is the gateway drug. Pro tier is where revenue comes from. Enterprise tier is where scale happens. But CLI must stand alone as genuinely useful, not crippled freemium.
